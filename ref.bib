@article{Tang2008,
abstract = {The dynamic performance of wind turbines indicates that the power extracted from the wind is strongly related to the inertia of the system and characteristics of wind speed. In this paper, a simulation model of a wind turbine system has been developed to study the effects of inertia. Three aspects of the dynamic performance of wind turbines are investigated in the paper: the prediction of the trend of the natural time-constant versus power rating for wind turbines, the effects of shaft speed on the actual time constant and the power loss due to inertia under varying wind speed conditions.},
